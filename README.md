# tokens-rotate-then-move
Ever think it is silly to have tokens rotate as they move? Don't want to rotate tokens toward where they are going before moving them?

Tokens rotate toward their destination before they move.

Can be toggled from token tools.

Rotation speed and movement duration can be customized in the settings.

The drag preview will show the rotation the token will rotate to.
